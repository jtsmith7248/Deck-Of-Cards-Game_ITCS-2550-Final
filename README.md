# UnsplashClient

Note: Actions Page has Changed, Badge No Longer Accessible.

Project utilizes vectors and Bubblesort algorithm from ch 16 in conjunction with with many important principles of OOP to get a program run
that creates a user interface to allow one to get data from the Unsplash Photos API. Tjis UI then has it sorted based on user's' criteria, and 
allow them to view a given photo by opening it in their broswer or scroll through results "page by page"; aka continue to make many calls from the 
API to see more than just 10 result from a given search term
